This uses [you-get](https://you-get.org/).

I originally wrote this in PowerShell, but opted to re-write it in Python and put it on my [Synology](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS1511+) to auto-download the latest episodes and put them where [Plex](http://plex.tv) will find them, keeping only the latest episodes since it's just the news.

Cheers!! :beers: 

# Download-EcuaVisa.ps1

PowerShell (POSH) to download the latest News Episodes from EcuaVisa archives.

I switched to Python, as stated above. There maybe some funcionality that's not optimized in PowerShell.

## ToDo

- Create a [REQUIREMENT.json](/Vertigion/REQUIREMENTS.json) for `you-get`.
