This uses [you-get](https://you-get.org/).

I [originally wrote this in PowerShell](https://github.com/VertigoRay/Download-EcuaVisa/blob/7123b6c918a6e44d28c6709f3a79d23d73c68d2c/Download-EcuaVisa.ps1), but opted to re-write it in Python and put it on my [Plex](http://plex.tv) server to auto-download the latest episodes and put them where [Plex](http://plex.tv) will find them, keeping only the latest episodes since it's just the news.

Cheers!! :beers:
